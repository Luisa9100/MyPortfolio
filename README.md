# MyPortfolio

My name is Marialuisa Giglio, I am currently studying Front End Development and I should get my qualification in February. I am doing this course through the
company Learning People where they give you the opportunity of studying in your own time and online, also with a mentor help you will always be followed during your course.
My first project is a Portfolio about my self and how I could help someone else that is looking to build or modify a website. In my first project I have used HTML and CSS. 
I will be happy to receive any kind of advices during my course to improve my knowledge in Web developer.
